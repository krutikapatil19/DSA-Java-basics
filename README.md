## About

**DSA-Java-basics** is a collection of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) concepts implemented in Java, with the goal of helping learners, interview preparers, and anyone looking to solidify their understanding of DSA. Clean, readable implementations & problemâ€‘solutions make this repository suitable for quick revision, handsâ€‘on practice, and concept clarity.

- **Arrays, Strings, LinkedList, Hashing, Recursion, Searching, Sorting, Stack**  
  Core DSA topics implemented in Java with multiple problemâ€‘solutions for each.

- **DSA_Patterns & Pattern_Problems**  
  Problem sets focusing on commonly used algorithmic patterns (e.g. sliding window, two pointers, divide & conquer etc.), and patternâ€‘based problems often seen in interviews.

| Topic         | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Arrays         | Searching, sorting, manipulations, subarrays, etc.                        |
| Strings        | Palindromes, substrings, pattern matching, etc.                          |
| LinkedList     | Insertions, deletions, merging, reversing, etc.                           |
| Hashing        | Hash maps / sets, frequency counting, anagram problems etc.              |
| Recursion      | Recursive algorithms, backtracking, tree / graph base cases etc.          |
| Searching      | Binary search, linear search etc.                                         |

## Sample Problems

Here are examples of problems you'll find in this repository:

- Reverse an array / array rotation  
- Check if string is palindrome  
- Detect loop in linked list  
- First nonâ€‘repeating character in a string (using hashing)  
- Implement binary search / merge sort / quick sort  
- Evaluate arithmetic expression using stack

## Getting Started

To run any of the programs locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krutikapatil19/DSA-Java-basics.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the topic folder of your interest. For example:
   ```bash
   cd DSA-Java-basics/Recursion
   ```
3. Compile the Java file(s), e.g.:
   ```bash
   javac SomeProblem.java
   ```
4. Run the compiled class:
   ```bash
   java SomeProblem
   ```

You may use any IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VSCode, etc.) or build tools (Maven/Gradle) if you wish to organize further.

Contributions are welcome! If you want to help improve this repo:

1. Fork the repository.  
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/YourFeatureName`  
3. Make your changes / add problem solutions following the coding guidelines.  
4. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Add <short description>"`  
5. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/YourFeatureName`

## Coding Guidelines

To maintain consistency and readability, please follow:

- Use **meaningful variable and method names**  
- Add comments where the logic is nonâ€‘trivial  
- Follow Java code conventions (camelCase, PascalCase for classes, etc.)  
- Handle edge cases (null inputs, empty arrays/strings etc.)  
- Ensure each class / file focuses on one problem or closely related group of problems
