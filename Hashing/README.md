## Hashing

Hashing is a smart technique to find or store data quickly — especially when you're working with large or similar types of data.
Imagine you're in a library with millions of books, and you want to find your book in just 1 second instead of searching shelf by shelf.
That's what hashing helps with — super fast searching, almost in O(1) time!
