# Two Pointer Technique
The two pointer technique is a problem-solving approach where we use two variables (pointers) to traverse data structures (like arrays or strings) from different directions (start & end, or with different speeds) to solve problems efficiently.

## Types of Two Pointer Approaches

### Opposite Ends: 
Start one pointer at the beginning, one at the end, and move inward.
Example: checking if a string is a palindrome.

### Same Direction: 
Both pointers start from the beginning, but move at different speeds (slow & fast).
Example: detecting cycle in a linked list.
