#Searching

Searching is a process of finding position of a target element in an array or list.  

## Types of Searching

-Linear Search - Checks element one by one

-Binary Search - Repeatedly divides the array into two halves to find the element , it compares the mid element with the key element and then accordingly checks either in the first half or the second half.It only works for sorted Arrays.
